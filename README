This document describes the common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with linux-yocto kernel.


Maintenance
-----------

Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.

Building the nxp-s32g2xx layer
-----------------------------
This layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This is done automatically
when using the Wind River setup.sh wrapper.

2. BSP Kernel and Distros
=========================

The following table summarizes the valid Wind River Linux distros for this BSP.
'Y' in each content cell stands for supported; 'N' stands for not supported:

  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
  | valid/distro |   wrlinux   | wrlinux-cgl | wrlinux-ovp |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
  |    valid     |      Y      |      N      |      N      |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

Note: The preempt-rt ktype is not available for this BSP/Machine at this time.


3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP
along with patch descriptions use git whatchanged on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
  # git whatchanged standard/base..HEAD


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

	- ipaddr
	- gatewayip
	- netmask
	- serverip
	- loadaddr
	- dtbfile
	- dtbaddr
	- ethaddr
	- eth1addr

Your board may ship with the values for the MAC address of
the Ethernet interfaces set to the defaults compiled into the
u-boot image.  You should set the ethaddr, eth1addr and so on
as per the manufacturer assigned values, usually indicated with
a sticker on the board.

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "bootfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyLF0 at 115200 baud. For the DTB
address, 0x90000000  was used with success by Wind River. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression. A value
of 0x81000000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate $othbootargs;tftp $loadaddr $bootfile; \
tftp $fdtaddr $fdtfile;booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr
ethaddr=00:04:9F:02:00:FD
eth1addr=00:04:9F:02:01:FD
eth2addr=00:04:9F:02:02:FD
loadaddr=0x81000000
fdtaddr=0x90000000
gatewayip=192.168.1.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.1.100
serverip=192.168.1.2
netdev=eth0
bootfile=Image
fdtfile=fsl-s32g274a-evb.dtb
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyLF0
baudrate=115200

Note:
By default, in u-boot eth0 is occupied by PFE mode. When in non-PFE mode
in order to switch eth0 to the GMAC by explicitly disabling and enabling
the GMAC driver. Run below commands in u-boot:

# s32ccgmac disable
# s32ccgmac enable
# setenv ethact eth_eqos

5. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-s32g2xx/wrlinux-image-glic-<rootfs_type>-nxp-s32g2xx.wic

Then user can write the output image to a SD card:

5.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn WIC image to SD card, user only need to execute the below command:

# dd if=wrlinux-image-small-nxp-s32g2xx.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

5.2 Set uboot env
-----------------

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

=> setenv bootfile Image; setenv fdtfile fsl-s32g274a-evb.dtb; setenv loadaddr 0x81000000; setenv fdtaddr 0x90000000;

=> setenv bootargs console=ttyLF0,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw

=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 0:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr'

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;

6. Features
===========

6.1 FLEXCAN
-----------

Detail verification commands as below:

	# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
	# ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
	# candump can0 &
	# cansend can1 5A1#11.22.33.44.55.66.77.88
	# ip -d -s link show can0
	# ip -d -s link show can1

If can0 dumps data from can1, FLEXCAN feature works fine.

Note: can0 is the J79 on the S32G-PROCEVB-S board, can1 & can2 is the J19 & J20
on the S32GRV-PLATEVB board.
