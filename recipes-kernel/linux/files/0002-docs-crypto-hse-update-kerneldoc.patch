 =================
 This driver is affected by the following known issues:
 
-- The crypto driver does not currently support the RNG non-blocking mode of
-  operation (the wait parameter from hwrng_read is ignored).
-
 - With standard firmware, hmac(sha384) and hmac(sha512) are not supported with
   keys between 64 and 128 bytes in length due to the firmware-imposed limits.
